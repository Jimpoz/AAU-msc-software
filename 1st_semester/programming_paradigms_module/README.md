## Learning Objectives

### Knowledge

The student should gain knowledge of the important concepts and terminology of programming paradigms. Furthermore, the student must gain a deeper understanding of one or more paradigms in relation to the prerequisites described. Specifically, the student should gain knowledge of at least the following:

- Advanced function-oriented programming, including referential transparency, evaluation order, closures, higher-order functions, continuations, and type systems for feature programming including parametric polymorphism.  
- Programming in languages with dynamic types  
- Programming techniques within one or more of the four main paradigms:  
  - Functional-oriented  
  - Imperative  
  - Object-oriented  
  - Logical programming paradigm  

### Skills

- Apply concepts and terminology important to the paradigm in question to describe and reason about programs from this paradigm  
- Explain how a program within the illuminated paradigms should be executed  
- Construct programs with high paradigmatic attention  
- Assess the strengths and weaknesses of each paradigm in relation to a specific programming problem  

### Competences

- Choose a suitable paradigm for a given task and argue for the choice made  
- Identify concepts and constructions in a given paradigm and argue how these differ from concepts and constructions in other paradigms  
- Apply paradigmatic constructions in smaller programs
