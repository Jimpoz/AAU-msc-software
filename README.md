This repository contains coursework, projects, and/or thesis work developed as part of the Master of Science and Engineering in Software program at Aalborg University. It reflects applied knowledge in areas such as software architecture, systems engineering, programming, and research.
Inside the repository you will find both mandatory courses and the one I personally chose from the curriculum.
