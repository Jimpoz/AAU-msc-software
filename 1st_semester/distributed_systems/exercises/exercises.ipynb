    "1. How might the clocks in two computers that are linked by a local network be\n",
    "synchronized without reference to an external time source? What factors limit the\n",
    "accuracy of the procedure you have described? How could the clocks in a large number of computers connected by the Internet be synchronized? Discuss the accuracy of that procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is the man disadvantage of distributed systems which exploit the infrastructure offered by the Internet? How can this be overcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The host computers used in peer-to-peer systems are often simply desktop computers in users’ offices or homes. What are the implications of this for the availability and security of any shared data objects that they hold and to what extent can any weaknesses be overcome through the use of replication?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. There exist services (e.g.: Network Time Protocol service) that can be used to synchronize computer clocks. Explain why, even with these service, no guaranteed bound is given for the difference between two clocks\n",

    "5. Speedup Calculation\n",
    "A program spends 60% of its execution time in a part that can be parallelized. The rest (40%) must remain sequential.\n",
    "According to Amdahl's Law, what is the maximum theoretical speedup if the parallel part is executed on:\n",
    "a) 2 processors\n",
    "b) 4 processors\n",
    "c) An infinite number of processors\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finding the Parallel Fraction\n",
    "An application achieves a speedup of 5 when running on 8 processors. Use Amdahl's Law to determine the fraction of the program that was parallelized."

    "### ANSWERS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If two computers are connected through a local network, they can synchronize their clocks without relying on an external time source by exchanging their current time values. To achieve accurate synchronization, the network latency must be measured. By estimating the message transmission delay, the difference between the clocks can be calculated and one machine’s clock adjusted accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A major disadvantage of distributed systems is the dependency between components—failure in one can affect the whole system. This issue can be mitigated through redundancy, ensuring backup resources are available when failures occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Host computers in homes or offices are typically just desktop machines. This setup results in poor availability and security since only a single device is used. To improve reliability, redundancy can be applied by duplicating resources digitally.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perfect time measurement is fundamentally impossible for digital devices. Even with synchronization using atomic clocks, absolute precision cannot be achieved due to unavoidable latencies in communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Amdahl’s Law is given by:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   S(N) = \\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \\frac{P}{N}}\n",
    "   $$\n",

    "     $$\n",
    "     S(2) = \\frac{1}{(1 - 0.60) + \\frac{0.60}{2}} = 1.43\n",

    "     $$\n",
    "     S(4) = \\frac{1}{(1 - 0.60) + \\frac{0.60}{4}} = 1.82\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Again, by Amdahl’s Law:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   S(N) = \\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \\frac{P}{N}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Given $S(N) = 5$ and $N = 8$:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   5 = \\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \\frac{P}{8}}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Rearranging:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   (1 - P) + \\frac{P}{8} = \\frac{1}{5}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   1 - \\frac{8P}{8} + \\frac{P}{8} = 0.2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   1 - \\frac{7P}{8} = 0.2\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   0.8 = \\frac{7P}{8}\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   P = \\frac{0.8 \\times 8}{7} = \\frac{6.4}{7} \\approx 0.914\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Hence, the parallel fraction is approximately **91.4%**.\n"
