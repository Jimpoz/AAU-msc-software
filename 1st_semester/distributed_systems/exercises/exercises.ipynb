    "1. How might the clocks in two computers that are linked by a local network be\n",
    "synchronized without reference to an external time source? What factors limit the\n",
    "accuracy of the procedure you have described? How could the clocks in a large number of computers connected by the Internet be synchronized? Discuss the accuracy of that procedure.\n",

    "2. What is the man disadvantage of distributed systems which exploit the infrastructure offered by the Internet? How can this be overcome?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The host computers used in peer-to-peer systems are often simply desktop computers in users’ offices or homes. What are the implications of this for the availability and security of any shared data objects that they hold and to what extent can any weaknesses be overcome through the use of replication?\n",
    "\n",

    "A program spends 60% of its execution time in a part that can be parallelized. The rest (40%) must remain sequential.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. If two computers are connected through a local network, they can synchronize their clocks without relying on an external time source by exchanging their current time values. To achieve accurate synchronization, the network latency must be measured. By estimating the message transmission delay, the difference between the clocks can be calculated and one machine’s clock adjusted accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A major disadvantage of distributed systems is the dependency between components—failure in one can affect the whole system. This issue can be mitigated through redundancy, ensuring backup resources are available when failures occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Host computers in homes or offices are typically just desktop machines. This setup results in poor availability and security since only a single device is used. To improve reliability, redundancy can be applied by duplicating resources digitally.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Perfect time measurement is fundamentally impossible for digital devices. Even with synchronization using atomic clocks, absolute precision cannot be achieved due to unavoidable latencies in communication.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. The crash recovery and crash silent are similar due to the fact that in both cases you're not sure if a process is going to fail. A crash silent event halts the process but the failure is not reliably detected while a crash recovery may fail and will recover later. So based on this assumption we can say that in both cases there's no certainty that a process will actually run.\n",
    "2. To create a stubborn point-to-point link using a fair-loss link API, we can implement a mechanism that continuously retransmits messages until an acknowledgment is received.\n",
    "A stuborn link is built upon a fair-loss link and it guarantees reliability. Implementing stubborn links can be done using a “Retransmit Forever” algorithm that builds upon an underlying fair-loss link. We know that the fair-loss link will drop a certain percentage of messages, but that some messages do reach their destination. If we keep retransmitting all messages sent, in the limit we overcome any possible dropped messages and can guarantee that every message is delivered.\n",
