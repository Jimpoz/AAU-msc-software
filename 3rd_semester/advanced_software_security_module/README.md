# Content, Progress and Pedagogy of the Module

## Objectives

- To familiarise the student with state-of-the-art research within select areas of software security, e.g., language-based security, secure information flow, secure programming languages, verified programming  
- To enable the student to assess and evaluate proposed or novel tools and techniques for software security  
- To familiarise the student with the theoretical foundations underlying key areas of software security, e.g., access control models, fuzzing, static analysis, symbolic execution, model checking, etc.  

## Learning Objectives

### Knowledge

Must have knowledge about:

- The theoretical foundations for one or more of the studied tools and techniques, in particular static analysis, model checking, and fuzzing  
- The limitations of the studied theories, tools, and techniques  
- Key points about the studied foundational theories, e.g., access control models or secure information flow  

### Skills

Must be able to:

- Deploy and use one or more software security tools or techniques for security analysis of a small software project  
- Evaluate potential (security-related) benefits or drawbacks of using the studied tools and theories on a small software project  
- Identify the best tool or technique to solve specific software security problems  

### Competences

Must have the competences to:

- Assess and evaluate the security relevance of different tools, methods, and processes used for developing small software projects  
- Evaluate and propose or adapt existing techniques to perform specific security-related analyses of software, e.g., extending an analysis method to cover new programming languages or new language features  
- Identify and research novel theories, tools, and techniques for software security  
- Communicate and teach core insights about novel and state-of-the-art research in software security
