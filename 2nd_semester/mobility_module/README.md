# Content, Progress and Pedagogy of the Module

## Purpose

The purpose of the project module is to help students gain knowledge about and develop mobile applications and services. Mobile applications and services must be understood broadly; they are specifically characterized by the use of equipment with limited resources in terms of screen, interaction, processor, and memory. At the same time, these are applications that, with a limited power consumption, can use wireless communication with other equipment and servers, and that the users and the equipment are mobile—i.e., able to move.

Mobile applications and services are used in a wide range of situations and environments where desktop technologies cannot be used.

**Justification:** Today, mobile technologies, applications, and services are key technological elements in society, organizations, and for the individual.

## Learning Objectives

### Knowledge

- Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the use of mobile technologies, mobile applications, and services  
- Understand and exploit concepts of mobile applications and services  
- Analyze and model requirements for a mobile application or service  
- Structure an application or service in a relevant software architecture using common design patterns  
- Design, realize, test, and evaluate a mobile application or service  
- Understand and explain what is special about mobile applications and services  

### Skills

- Carry out analysis, design, programming, and evaluation of mobile applications and services  
- Demonstrate and apply techniques, models, methods, and tools to develop mobile applications and services  
- Argue for the choices made in all the activities of the development process, including explaining how requirements, architecture, and users' needs are related  
- Develop a mobile application or service using minimal resources such as screen, interaction, processor, power consumption, and memory  
- Take advantage of wireless communication with other equipment or servers and mobile features such as location and user mobility  

### Competences

- Be able to develop a running mobile application or service that solves the users' problem  
- Be able to describe and reflect on the form of work used in the development project  
- Be able to assess scalability and “quality of service” using experimental methods  

## Type of Instruction

**Project work including:**

- An analysis of a problem whose solution can naturally be described in the form of analysis, design, and realization of a specific mobile application or service  
- Design, implementation, testing, and evaluation of a mobile application or service  
- Assessment of scalability and “quality of service” using experimental methods  
- Well-performed experiments  
- Reflection on the development process that has taken place
