# Content, Progress and Pedagogy of the Module

## Purpose

That the student can formulate, analyze, and contribute to solving a current research problem in computer science independently, systematically, and critically through the application of scientific theory and method.

## Reason

University programs are research-based programs; all students must obtain in-depth knowledge of the current research problems and methods in the master's program, so that this insight can be used to solve problems in research.

## Learning Objectives

### Knowledge

- Document in-depth knowledge and overview of a current problem in computer science research and its possible solutions

### Skills

- Be able to reason about and with the concepts and techniques concerned  
- Be able to apply and create theoretical frameworks in the subject area in connection with the formulation, analysis, and solution of a problem in computer science research  
- Be able to convey a current computer science problem, a contribution to its solution, and the related conceptual apparatus within the framework of the research area  

### Competences

- Be able to use the concepts and reasoning in the subject area to formulate, analyze, and contribute to solving a problem within a current problem in computer science research
