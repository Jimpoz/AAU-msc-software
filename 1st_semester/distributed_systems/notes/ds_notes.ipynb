    "## What is a distributed systems?\n",
    "A distributed system is one where hardware and software components in/on networked computers communicate and coordinate their activity only by passing messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## CONCURRENCY\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency is the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks or processes simultaneously or at overlapping times, improving efficiency.\n",
    "However it can cause some problems such as:\n",
    "- Deadlocks and livelocks: these are conditions in which the processes do not make progress due to their circumstances.\n",
    "- Non-determinism: occurs when the output or behavior of a concurrent program differs for the same input, depending on the precise, unpredictable timing of events, such as thread interleaving or resource access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other issues could rise from the absence of shared state that will eventually lead to:\n",
    "- Pass messages to synchronize: for example if 2 people have a shared resource and both are trying to access it at the same time an error could occur for one member of the party.\n",
    "- May not agree on time: \n",
    "\n",
    "Everything can fail in distributed systems:\n",
    "- Devices\n",
    "- Integrity of data\n",
    "- Network\n",
    "    - Security\n",
    "    - Man-in-the-Middle (MITM): attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and potentially alters communication between two legitimate parties, unbeknownst to them.\n",
    "    - Zibantine failure: is a condition of a system, particularly a distributed computing system, where a fault occurs such that different symptoms are presented to different observers, including imperfect information on whether a system component has failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed systems are used for domain, redundancy, and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain\n",
    "A domain is a specific area of knowledge or activity that a distributed system is designed to address.\n",
    "Some examples of domains are:\n",
    "- The internet\n",
    "- Wireless Mesh Networks\n",
    "- Industrail systems\n",
    "- Ledgers (bitcoin, ethereum)\n",
    "However these domains can encounter some limits that can be physical and logical.\n",
    "- Physical limits: are constraints imposed by the physical properties of the system's components or environment, such as hardware limitations, network bandwidth, latency, and geographical distribution.   \n",
    "- Logical limits: defined by its bounded context. This is a core concept from Domain-Driven Design (DDD). The logical limit of a domain in a distributed system is defined by its bounded context. This is a core concept from Domain-Driven Design (DDD), a software development approach that focuses on aligning software design with the business domain. A bounded context is an explicit boundary within a distributed system where a specific domain model and its language (ubiquitous language) are consistent and applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Redundancy\n",
    "A system with redundacy means that it has duplicate ocmponents, processes or data.\n",
    "Given these specifications the system will result:\n",
    "- Robust: more resilient to failure\n",
    "- Available: as in system availability which is measured in uptime.\n",
    "\n",
    "A system with redundancy can:\n",
    "- offer 99.9% uptime or \"five nines\": means it's designed to be operational and available 99.9% of the time, with a small amount of planned or unplanned downtime.\n",
    "- be a backup: in an active-passive configuration, the redundant server acts as a hot or cold backup. The primary server handles all the workload, while the backup server waits on standby. Given the duplication of information and components if one fails the other automatically takes over.\n",
    "- be a database: In an active-active configuration, all redundant servers are considered active and work together simultaneously. They are not simply waiting as a backup. Incoming requests are distributed among all the servers using a load balancer.\n",
    "- used in the banking sector: any downtime can lead to significant financial losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performance\n",
    "To ensure a performant system we need:\n",
    "- Economics\n",
    "- Scalability\n",
    "Here we talk about different topics such as:\n",
    "- Video streaming: requires a lot of procesing power\n",
    "- Cloud computing: Offers on-demand, scalable resources, eliminating the need for upfront hardware investment.\n",
    "- Supercomputers: Excel at massive, specialized calculations but are very expensive and not scalable for general-purpose use.\n",
    "- Many inexpensive vs many expensive specialized: Distributing workloads across many inexpensive machines is often more economical and scalable than using a few expensive, specialized ones."

    "Why make distributed systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is distributed by definition: ...telecommunications...\n",
    "- For reliability: even if one node fails, the system keeps funtioning.\n",
    "- Performance: share load of computation, get data from nearby.\n",
    "- To handle bigger problems: Literally some problems have so much data they don’t fit in one machine.\n",

    "Instructor: Elli Anastasiadi ellia@cs.aau.dk | DS Lecture 2Models of distrubuted systems\n",
    "6We want/will make:\n",
    "▶ APIs for modules and show that together they have some properties, and\n",
    "▶ Implement the modules so that they satisfy some local properties.\n",
    "In this part often: pseudo code + math to show that the above are not possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Failures\n",
    "Failures are inevitable in distributed systems. They can occur due to various reasons, such as hardware malfunctions, software bugs, network issues, or human errors. Understanding and handling failures is crucial for designing robust and reliable distributed systems.\n",
    "### Types of failures\n",
    "1. crash-stop: A process can crash, but all crashes can be reliably detected by\n",
    "everyone else. These are the best .\n",
    "2. crash-silent: where process crashes can never be reliably detected,\n",
    "3. crash-noisy: crashes can be detected some times (accuracy only eventually).\n",
    "4. crash-recovery: where processes can crash and later recover and still participate\n",
    "(carefull for omissions).\n",
    "5. crash-arbitrary: where processes can deviate arbitrarily from the protocol\n",
    "specification and act in malicious, adversarial ways. Also called Byzantine failures.\n",
    "These are the worst .\n",
    "6. (Extra, odd category) randomized. Where processes might make some choises.\n",
    "Correcness comes from probability theory (or not)\n",

    "4. Logged-perfect: like perfect, but with logging.\n",
    "5. Authenticated: reliable delivery + no duplication + authenticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Can networks fail?\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to TCP, and other lower-level protocols, we usually only deal with perfect links, and\n",
    "with fail-stop (i.e. detectable) crushes.\n",
    "However:\n",

    "▶ Suppose there is a sequence of a fixed number of messages that does the job.\n",
    "▶ By assumption this sequence makes generals attack at same time.\n",
    "▶ Consider the last such message that was successfully delivered (if not . . .).\n",
    "▶ Capture this messenger.\n",
    "▶ The receiver general would decide not to attack (if not . . .).\n",
    "▶ Sender general cannot distinguish the two scenaria, and since his behaviour is\n",
    "deterministic he must decide the same before, i.e., attack.\n",
    "▶ We’ve now created a situation where the suggested protocol leads one general to\n",
