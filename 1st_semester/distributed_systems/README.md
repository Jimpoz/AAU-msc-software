# Content, Progress and Pedagogy of the Module

## Learning Objectives

### Knowledge

The student should gain knowledge of basic and advanced theories and methods in distributed systems:

- **Distributed systems models**:  
  Structuring (including, e.g., peer-to-peer, client-server, service-oriented architecture) and behavior (communication, error, and security models)
- **Time concept in distributed systems**:  
  Clock synchronization and logical time
- **Distributed algorithms**:  
  Algorithms for mutual exclusion, selection, consensus, transactions, replication, and error tolerance
- **Programming of distributed systems**:  
  Languages, coordination models, principles for distribution of calculation and data
- **One or more topics among**:
  - Techniques for analysis, such as monitoring, testing, formal verification, and benchmarking
  - Designing and building complex distributed infrastructures and applications for e.g. IoT, cloud, peer-to-peer, distributed embedded systems
  - System and network software for (distributed) embedded systems
  - Distributed and parallel computation, parallel algorithms
  - Advanced security solutions

### Skills

- Be able to explain precisely and using the terminology and notation of the subject  
- Assess how and to what extent the results presented can be used  
- Designing and deploying distributed applications  

### Competences

- Be able to apply concepts and techniques from distributed systems to the design and analysis of distributed systems
