    "1. If two computers are connected through a local network, they can synchronize their clocks without relying on an external time source by exchanging their current time values. To achieve accurate synchronization, the network latency must be measured. By estimating the message transmission delay, the difference between the clocks can be calculated and one machine’s clock adjusted accordingly.\n",

    "2. A major disadvantage of distributed systems is the dependency between components—failure in one can affect the whole system. This issue can be mitigated through redundancy, ensuring backup resources are available when failures occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Host computers in homes or offices are typically just desktop machines. This setup results in poor availability and security since only a single device is used. To improve reliability, redundancy can be applied by duplicating resources digitally.\n",

Conversely, a **99.9% SLA** is extremely demanding for a solo operator, requiring sophisticated automated failover systems and 24/7 availability that are difficult to manage alone. A **99% uptime** is a professional standard that assures customers of reliability while providing a practical buffer for unforeseen issues, maintenance, and manual recovery.\n",

    "#### **Managing a 99% SLA**\n",
    "\n",
    "With **438.3 minutes** of downtime allowed per month, the number of crashes you can handle depends entirely on your **Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)**—the average time it takes to fix a problem from the moment you're alerted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume your MTTR is 2 hours (120 minutes). This includes the time to be notified, diagnose the problem, and deploy a fix. In this scenario, you could handle: 438.3 minutes / 120 minutes/crash ≈ 3.65 crashes per month\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you could manage about **3 to 4 significant outages** per month.\n",

    "* **Excellent Monitoring:** Automated alerts sent directly to your phone.\n",
    "* **Rapid Diagnosis:** Good logging and diagnostic tools to find the root cause quickly.\n",
    "* **Efficient Resolution:** A streamlined process for deploying fixes or restarting services.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a single crash takes longer to fix (e.g., it happens overnight while you're asleep), it could consume your entire monthly downtime budget in one incident.\n",

    "\n",
    "Azure achieves these incredibly high uptime numbers through massive investment in **redundancy and automation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Redundancy at All Levels:**\n",
    "    * **Hardware:** Individual servers have redundant power supplies, network cards, and RAID storage.\n",
    "    * **Availability Sets:** This feature ensures your VMs are placed in different server racks within the same datacenter. This protects against rack-level failures like a faulty power distribution unit or network switch.\n",
    "    * **Availability Zones:** This is the highest level of protection. It places your VMs in physically separate datacenters within the same region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking. This protects against catastrophic events like a fire or total power loss to an entire building.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Automation and Orchestration:**\n",
    "    * **Health Monitoring:** Systems constantly monitor the health of the underlying hardware.\n",
    "    * **Automated Failover:** If a server is about to fail, Azure can automatically live-migrate a VM to a healthy server with no downtime.\n",
    "    * **Rapid Provisioning:** Software-defined infrastructure allows for the near-instant deployment of new resources to replace failed ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Expert Staff:** Microsoft employs a global team of engineers working 24/7/365 in Network Operations Centers (NOCs) to respond to incidents immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Sampling Frequency**\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft Azure's standard **sampling frequency for VM health metrics is one minute**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SLA document specifies that \"Downtime is defined as two consecutive minutes of no External Connectivity.\" This implies that their monitoring system must be checking the VM's status at least once per minute to be able to reliably detect a two-minute continuous outage. This one-minute interval is a standard feature of Azure Monitor for collecting performance and health metrics from virtual machines.\n",
