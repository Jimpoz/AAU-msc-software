# Content, Progress and Pedagogy of the Module

## PURPOSE

The purpose of the project module is to contribute to the students gaining knowledge about and being able to develop an internet application or service. Internet application or service must be understood broadly and ranges from the more common internet applications to autonomous agents and the so-called "Internet of Things", where the internet is used to link physical objects, such as household electronics, where a traditional browser-based user interface is not necessarily used.

## REASONS

The internet, internet technologies, internet services, and internet applications are all key technological elements in today's society.

## Learning Objectives

### Knowledge

- Demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the internet, internet technologies and internet services  
- Understand and utilize internet concepts  
- Analyze and model requirements for internet application development  
- Structure an application in a multilayer architecture using common application patterns  
- Design, implement and test an internet application or service  

### Skills

- Carry out systematic testing of the application / service and demonstrate that the application / service corresponds to the intentions and needs of the users  
- Carry out systematic evaluation of the selected user interface  
- Argue for choices made in all activities of the development process, including explaining requirements, architecture and that users' needs are related  
- Demonstrate skills in the development of an internet application or service of high, internal and external quality, focusing on a scalable architecture and "quality of service"  

### Competences

- Develop a running internet application or service that solves the users' problem  
- Describe and reflect on the form of work used in the development project  
- Apply project management  

## Type of Instruction

Project work to include:

- An analysis of a problem whose solution can naturally be described in the form of analysis, design and realization of a specific internet application or service  
- Design, implementation and testing of an internet application or service  
- Assessment of scalability and “quality of service” using experimental methods  
- Reflection on one's own development process
